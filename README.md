# 🌠 Ausonia

## ✨ Overview
        
***Ausonia*** is an Open Source Discord Bot, written in Python with the Pycord Framework. The
main feature and purpose of the Bot is to bring a more convenient and easier way to use
Text-To-Image Models (For example, Stable Diffusion), through an interface that most users will
be familiar with. As the project evolved over the duration of its development, I then made the
decision to turn Ausonia into more of a general purpose bot, with the Text-To-Image functionality
being its main feature.
